##Domain Overview

The intended users of the system are prospective undergraduate students and lecturers of the Faculty of Science. Prospective students should register for an examination by filling an online application given at the end of the assignment. 
Assume that undergraduate studies will be offered in eight subjects: Botany, Chemistry, Computer Science, Geology, Mathematics, and Molecular biology, Physics, Statistics and Zoology. For each subject a collection of courses are offered in each of the two semesters. Registered students could be able to sit for any examination conducted for any semester. Generally, there are multiple examinations per course per semester. Your system must facilitate students to select any of such exams. When students are sitting for an examination, answers must be automatically submitted at the end of the allowed time period so that students cannot work after that.
Examinations are generated by instructors who teach courses. The system should have features to generate an exam by editing an online paper. In other words, there should be facilities for instructors to create MCQ and short answer questions for a selected course. In case of MCQs instructor must be able to edit the question and set of answers. For short answer questions they edit the question and the answer. Once an instructor created a paper, it should be stored in a database. When an examination is over instructor will mark the paper online. In marking, instructor login and enter the registration number of a student.
